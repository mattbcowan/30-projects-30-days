## My process

For this project I started by creating a styles.css file and cleaning up the HTML to better separate the content. It will change as we move through the project but for right now all I did was add headers, paragraphs and some buttons in order to make this a little more easy to read.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
