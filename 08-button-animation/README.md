## My process

I wanted to take it a little easier this go round. I wanted to make a simple button that disappeared and revealed "Sent". That's it.

I started off with getting my files in order. I connected and tested my stylesheet and scripts. Once those were connected I made my button. I went through the entire styling process for the button to get it looking how I wanted before anything else. I've been finding that if I focus on one small task at a time rather than thinking about the entire project I get things done much faster and better quality.

Once the button was styled I made my animation for the button. I went through a few iterations but the one I landed on I'm happy with. It looks nice and simple. Many of the other animations were over the top in my opinion.

Now that the button is fully completed it was time to work on the "Sent" portion. This was pretty straight forward as I just wanted it to reveal once the button disappeared so a simple fade in would do. As it's just text there wasn't much styling to do aside from lining it up with the icon.

Once everything was done in CSS I moved onto the JavaScript. The timing was key so I went and looked up how to delay execution of code. It seemed like a `setTimeout` would be the simplest way to go about it so that's what I went with. All I did was add a class to the items after a certain delay and it was complete.

### Built with

- CSS Animations
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned quite a bit more about CSS animations. I like using keyframes since it gives more control but there's so many premade ones that I'm sure I could have cut down quite a bit of code with them. With this being such a small project I didn't find it necessary.

### Continued development

As I'm expanding more into front end JavaScript I'm getting more and more intrigued. I'm really enjoying everything that you can do with it. I can't wait to find out how to make more interactions and make some very interesting components.

### Useful resources

- [MDN - CSS Animations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) - This documentation has been an incredible resource.
