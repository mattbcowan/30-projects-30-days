# 30 Projects in 30 Days

## Objective

I want to build 30 projects in 30 days to force myself to learn web development better. Along with this I want to get better at pushing products to the public while having a deadline. This will be updated slowly as I go but the main focus is the projects at the moment. ðŸ‘Œ
