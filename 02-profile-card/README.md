## My process

Let's get started. First off, in yesterday's build I realized that I forgot to make ANY MEDIA QUERIES. I messed up. So today we are starting out mobile first. To begin I'm making a styles.css and adding in my initial styles from the style guide and my desktop media query.

After getting the styles set up I went in and adjusted the HTML to section things out. This is pretty standard for me with these Frontend Mentor projects.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

### Continued development

### Useful resources
