## My process

I started off by opening the provided designs. I determined the different sections of the project and blocked them off in Figma. Once I had them determined I went into the HTML and separated the sections out so that it would be easier to read. After that I created a styles.css and imported it to the HTML along with the fonts and icons.

Once I had the HTML set up I added in some basic styling for the pieces in styles.css. Mobile layout was up first as I find it the easiest to start with. Once I had the basic styling down I went ahead and added in some hover effects to the buttons.

### Built with
