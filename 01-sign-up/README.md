## Process

I started off by finding a good [reference image](https://collectui.com/designers/davidjnf/sign-up) to base the project on. I really liked the simplicity of [David Fran√ßa's](https://dribbble.com/davidjnf) login page so I based mine off of that. I didn't want to spend much time designing my own when there's plenty of people out there that can design SIGNIFICANTLY better than me.

Next I laid out the HTML and looked into [how to structure web forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) so that they would be much more accessible. I started learning about accessibility recently and it's really grabbed my attention quite a bit. It makes sense that everyone should be able to use the web regardless of any personal issues you may deal with and I really want to strive to make my sites as accessible from a programming perspective as possible.
